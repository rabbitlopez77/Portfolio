    <div id="project-1">
      <h1 id="project-1-title">Project 1</h1>
        <p>Here is my 1st project. It was all about CSS. I am caple of adding different layers to the pages.
        I am capable of having animations and timings for those animations. I am capable of having adding 
        elements of CSS that when clicked on, can have some sort of action. I am capable of handling any css 
        assignment.
        </p>
          <a id="project-1-link" href="/My Portfolio/project-1.html" target="_blank">Project 1</a>
    </div>
    <div id="project-2">
      <h1 id="project-2-title">Project 2</h1>
        <p>Here is my 2nd project. It shows more of my capabilities with css. This time with more of an 
          emphasis on animation. As you can see I have added changing colors along with a fluid animation of the 
          ferris wheel. The ferris wheel seats look like they have weight to them and flow like they would 
          in the real world.
        </p>
          <a id="project-2-link" href="/My Portfolio/project-2.html" target="_blank">Project2</a>
    </div>
    <div id="project-3">
      <h1 id="project-3-title" >Project 3</h1>
        <p>Here is my 3rd project. This shows that I am ccapable of ccreating any kind of web page that you need.
          I can add vidoes or images and place them wherever you'd like. With any kind of instructions I ccan create
           any kind of page.
        </p>
